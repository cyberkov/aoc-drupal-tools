aoc-drupal-tools is a collection of Drupal Modules to maintain a Age of Conan Guild Website.

Most of the modules heavily rely on [http://code.google.com/p/bebot-aoc/ Bebot Hyborian] to acquire it's data from the game.

Currently available features are:
  * Automatically granting access to valid guild members to the forum
  * Display the City's build progress on the page
  * Sync professions to Bebot, so it can be displayed in the Game
  * [http://code.google.com/p/eqdkp/ EqDKP] Support for your site
  * Display currently in Game online Users on your site
  * Remind users in Game that they should register on the forums (this is a bebot module)
